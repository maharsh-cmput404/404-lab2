1) socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
2) Server socket waits for data/connections and a client socket sends data/initializes connections
3) We can instruct the OS to let us use the same port by passing in the 
socket.SO_REUSEADDR flag before binding. This helps in certain edge cases 
and will allow a new program to rebind to the same IP/port combination
4) We get the IP address and the PORT.
5) The full data including the headers + payload is returned
